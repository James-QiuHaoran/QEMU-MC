=============================
Running With JRE 6 Or Later
=============================

(1) Download and Install Java

  On *nix:

      $apt-get install default-jdk

(2) Configure Environment Variables

(2.1) Set CATALINA_HOME (required)

The CATALINA_HOME environment variable should be set to the location of the
root directory of the "binary" distribution of Tomcat.

The Tomcat startup scripts have some logic to set this variable
automatically if it is absent, based on the location of the startup script
in *nix.


(3) Start Up Tomcat

(3.1) Tomcat can be started by executing one of the following commands:

  On *nix:

      $CATALINA_HOME/bin/startup.sh

(3.2) After startup, the default web applications included with Tomcat will be
      available by visiting:

      http://localhost:8080/


(4) Shut Down Tomcat

(4.1) Tomcat can be shut down by executing one of the following commands:

  On *nix:

      $CATALINA_HOME/bin/shutdown.sh

==================================================
Advanced Configuration - Multiple Tomcat Instances
==================================================

When running with a separate CATALINA_HOME and CATALINA_BASE, the files
and directories are split as following:

In CATALINA_BASE:

 * conf - Server configuration files (including server.xml)

 * lib  - Libraries and classes, as explained below

 * logs - Log and output files

 * webapps - Automatically loaded web applications


In CATALINA_HOME:

 * bin  - Startup and shutdown scripts

 * lib  - Libraries and classes, as explained below

In general it is advised to never share libraries between web applications,
but put them into WEB-INF/lib directories inside the applications.


================
Troubleshooting
================

There are only really 1 thing likely to go wrong during the stand-alone
Tomcat install:

(1) The most common hiccup is when another web server (or any process for that
    matter) has laid claim to port 8080.  This is the default HTTP port that
    Tomcat attempts to bind to at startup.  To change this, open the file:

       $CATALINA_HOME/conf/server.xml

    and search for '8080'.  Change it to a port that isn't in use, and is
    greater than 1024, as ports less than or equal to 1024 require superuser
    access to bind under UNIX.

    Restart Tomcat and you're in business.  Be sure that you replace the "8080"
    in the URL you're using to access Tomcat.  For example, if you change the
    port to 1977, you would request the URL http://localhost:1977/ in your
    browser.
