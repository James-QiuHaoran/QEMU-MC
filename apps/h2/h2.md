## Supported Platforms

As this database is written in Java, it can run on many different platforms. It is tested with Java 7. All major operating systems (Mac OS, Ubuntu,...) are supported.

## Connecting to a Database using JDBC
To connect to a database, a Java application first needs to load the database driver, and then gets a connection. A simple way to do that using the following code:
```
import java.sql.*;
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] a)
            throws Exception {
        Class.forName("org.h2.Driver");
        Connection conn = DriverManager.
            getConnection("jdbc:h2:~/test", "sa", "");
        // add application code here
        conn.close();
    }
}
```
This code first loads the driver (`Class.forName(...)`) and then opens a connection (using `DriverManager.getConnection()`). The driver name is `"org.h2.Driver"`. The database URL always needs to start with `jdbc:h2:` to be recognized by this database. The second parameter in the `getConnection()` call is the user name (`sa` for System Administrator in this example). The third parameter is the password.

## Using the Server
### Starting the Server Tool from Command Line
To start the `Server` tool from the command line with the default settings, run: 
```
java -cp h2*.jar org.h2.tools.Server

TCP server running at tcp://127.0.1.1:9092 (only local connections)
Web Console server running at http://127.0.1.1:8082 (only local connections)
...
```
This will start the tool with the default options. To get the list of options and default values, run:
```
java -cp h2*.jar org.h2.tools.Server -?
```
### Connecting to the TCP Server
To remotely connect to a database using the TCP server, use the following driver and database URL:
- JDBC driver class: `org.h2.Driver`
- Database URL: `jdbc:h2:tcp://localhost/~/test`
