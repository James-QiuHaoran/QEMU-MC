=============================
Running With JRE 6 Or Later
=============================

(1) Download and Install a Java SE Runtime Environment (JRE)

(1.1) Download a Java SE Runtime Environment (JRE),
      release version 6 or later, from
      http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

(1.2) Install the JRE according to the instructions included with the
      release.

      You may also use a full Java Development Kit (JDK) rather than just
      a JRE.

(2) Configure Environment Variables

(2.1) Set CATALINA_HOME (required)

The CATALINA_HOME environment variable should be set to the location of the
root directory of the "binary" distribution of Tomcat.

The Tomcat startup scripts have some logic to set this variable
automatically if it is absent, based on the location of the startup script
in *nix.


(3) Start Up Tomcat

(3.1) Tomcat can be started by executing one of the following commands:

  On *nix:

      $CATALINA_HOME/bin/startup.sh

(3.2) After startup, the default web applications included with Tomcat will be
      available by visiting:

      http://localhost:8080/


(4) Shut Down Tomcat

(4.1) Tomcat can be shut down by executing one of the following commands:

  On *nix:

      $CATALINA_HOME/bin/shutdown.sh

==================================================
Advanced Configuration - Multiple Tomcat Instances
==================================================

When running with a separate CATALINA_HOME and CATALINA_BASE, the files
and directories are split as following:

In CATALINA_BASE:

 * lib  - Libraries and classes, as explained below

 * logs - Log and output files

 * webapps - Automatically loaded web applications


In CATALINA_HOME:

 * bin  - Startup and shutdown scripts

 * lib  - Libraries and classes, as explained below

In general it is advised to never share libraries between web applications,
but put them into WEB-INF/lib directories inside the applications.
