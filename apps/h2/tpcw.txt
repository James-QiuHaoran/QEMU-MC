INSTALLATION:

The process of setting up TPC-W takes the following steps:

1. Install Tomcat
   a. Create a context (or web application) called servlet for our web service in
      Tomcat, by creating a sub-directory called servlet under
      $CATALINA_HOME\webapps. Also create a subdirectory "WEB-INF" and
      sub-sub-directory "WEB-INF\classes" under the context root directory.

2. Populate the database 
   a. Set the dbName, and driverName variables appropriately in the file
      TPCW_Populate.java
   b. Compile the TPCW_Populate program, using the Makefile in the populate
      directory
   c. Run the TPCW_Populate program.

2. Build the TPC provided image creation program, which resides in the
   ImgGen directory
   a. make from ImgGen/ImgFiles

3. Run the image population script, which creates an image for every item
   in the database.
   a. Make sure perl is installed
   b. Change the variable $DEST_DIR in the file populate/populate_images
      sctript for your specific installation 
   c. Run the populate/populate_images script (perl populate_images)

4. Copy all of the image files from the images directory into the
   same directory where the image population script created all of the
   images. Copy the images to $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/ROOT/tpcw/Images.

6. Build the java servlets
   a. Edit the file servlets/TPCW_Database.java, modifying the variables 
      "driverName" and "jdbcPath" for your particular DB installation.
      (same change as in TPCW_Populate.java)
   b. In all servlets, did replacing of ";$sessionid$" to ";jsessionid="
   c. changed issues with dates in TPCW_Database.java:
      "CURRENT TIMESTAMP" to "CURRENT_TIMESTAMP"
      "CURRENT DATE" to "CURRENT_DATE"
   d. Build the servlets, using servlets/Makefile
   e. Copy servlets + classes into "WEB-INF\classes".
   f. Put the web configuration file "web.xml" and save it in "WEB-INF".

7. Build the RBE
   a. in rbe.java, changed ";$sessionid$" to ";jsessionid="
   b. javac rbe/* from the root tpcw directory. (use -source 1.3 or lower
      to use 'assert' as an identifier)

8. Test
   a. Issue the following URL (assuming that Tomcat is running in port 8080):
      http://localhost:8080/tpcw/

8. Run the RBE, see the runtpcw file for examples
   a. java -mx512M rbe.RBE -EB rbe.EBTPCW1Factory 30 -OUT run1.m -RU 100 -MI
      1000 -RD 100 -WWW http://localhost:8080/ -CUST 144000 -ITEM 10000 -TT 1.0
